PROPOSAL 
What will (likely) be the name of your instrument?

TriPlay

In a paragraph or two, tell me about your instrument and how you intend to implement it.

I am currently working on a project using 3 flex pressure sensors to control different parameters of a 3 part music patch. I bought a glove with a rubber coat on the palm side that can have the sensors soldered too for easy use. This will also prevent people from bending the sensor the wrong way. Since I want it to be musical I’m making a granulator patch for variable pad sounds, a drum sample playback patch with varying speed, an arpeggiator patch featuring the reverb/delay patch I’ve made before. 

I also want to use an accelerometers in case I want to add additional features that could be played with 2 hands. The accelerometer will probably be used to make a effects rack with patches I’ve made for delay, reverb, saturation etc. 

Good outcome deliverable – Write a list of features of what you WILL achieve no matter what.

I will definitely build the 3 patches: drum sample playback patch, simple granulator , arpeggiator with variable pad sounds that can be controlled with flex sensors.

Better outcome deliverable – Expand your previously written list of features to include what you THINK you will accomplish before the project’s deadline.

I will work to make my current effects patches usable with the material and add an accelerometer to control it.  my current effects patches usable with the material. 

Best outcome deliverable – Expand your previously written list of features to include what you HOPE you will accomplish before the project’s deadline.

The best outcome would be able to include a melodic instrument that sounds good and not just an arpeggiator. But I’m trying to figure out how I can do this with an accelerometer (maybe If I limit to a mode.)

In a paragraph or two, outline your next steps and tell me what additional skills you will require and what topics you might research for the completion of this project.

I am going to finish my max patches by Nov 25. I intend to be able to make a prototype this weekend.  I require to solder my sensors on my glove. 
It is good to note that I’m trying to make my patches in RNBO so I can export it to a ranpberry pi and play the instrument without my laptop. I don’t know if this is fully possible. So that will be something I try during the break.
