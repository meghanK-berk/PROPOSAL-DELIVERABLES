## 1. Overview

This instrument will be used to explore the different possibilites of using hand motion to generate information that can be used to produce music. 

## 2. Usage Instructions

1. Load the "Harp_Warble_Sample.wav" sample on your granulator (the blue box)
2. Click on the drum preset you may want. 
3. Check levels to avoid possible clipping while testing your audio output
4. Turn on the output/ezdac by clicking the button
5. Your granulator will start to play the sample loaded. At this point you may play with the reverb length and amount via the ultrasonic sensor.
6. You might be able to play with the wet settings via the flex sensor. The more the bend the more the reverb. 
7. You can play a beat using flex sensors to get the kick and snare.
8. The snare can be shaped to play accordingly inside of max. 
9.The flex has been set so that if you are maximum bend you will get reverb on your snare. 
10. There are 3 flex sensors, all of them are controlling time based effects or textural effects like the metallic texture on the snare. The snare was made using modal resonances to develop a metallic tone. 
11. You may try other samples but the granulator does not yet have appropriate methods of controlling the clipping. Please check carefully! I find short and transient sounds work best.
